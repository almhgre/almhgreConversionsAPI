# Facebook's Conversions API Tag for Google Tag Manager(server-side)

The Conversions API allows advertisers to send web events from their servers directly to Facebook. Server events are linked to a pixel and are processed like browser pixel events. This means that server events are used in measurement, reporting, and optimization in the same way as browser pixel events.

Google Tag Manager(GTM) have released support for their [Server-side](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/) support for sharing customer actions with analytics partners directly from Advertisers' servers.

This template is a tag that reads the standard event schema thatâ€™s sent from the client running on a tagging server. It then converts events to the appropriate schema and sends them through Conversions API. The Tag supports the below clients,

* [GA4 Client](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/send-data#server-side_client_configuration)
* [Facebook Conversions API Client](https://github.com/almhgre/almhgreConversionsAPI
